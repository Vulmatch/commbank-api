# CommBank app.

I have redeveloped the Commbank API. Now users can enter their login credentials to download the transactions (within the recent two years). And they can Audit the transaction. This app was developed under my customer's request. My customer is a landlord and manage the house renting. He has several renters and their names should be put into the renters.cfg. Note that the name should match the account name shown in your commbank transaction for a match. 


After downloading the transactions, you can audit the record, by looking at each transaction of each renter.


Below is their original readme

# CommBank API

Unofficial API client for the Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CommBank) NetBank.

> NOTE ⚠️: This project is not being maintained, I do not actively use commbank at the moment, but I may fixup this project if I have time. This project is based on some old code I wrote just for personal use and is not the best, but hopefully the code here can help others make API clients for commbank.

## Usage

```python
from commbank import CommBank

client = CommBank(timeout=10)

client.login(USERNAME, PASSWORD)
```

### Accounts

```python
account = client.get_account(12345678)

print(account)
```

For each account, there are following properties:

- `name`: Account name;
- `bsb`: BSB number;
- `number`: Account number (without BSB part);
- `balance`: Current account balance.
- `available_balance`: Current available funds of the account.
- `link`: Transaction page for the account, it will be different everytime you login;

### Transactions

```python
transactions = client.get_transactions(account)

print(json.dumps(transactions, indent=4))
```

For each transaction object, there are following properties:

- `timestamp`: Timestamp of given transaction, it's milliseconds since epoch. Although, it might be pretty accurate for some accounts (non-credit card account), it might just be accurate at date level.
- `date`: It's human readable date format.
- `payee`: The payee parsed from the transaction (this is far from perfect at the moment).
- `description`: Transaction description with the payee removed.
- `raw_description`: The raw description from the transaction (before we attempt to split it into the payee and description).
- `amount`: Transaction amount, negative value is DR, positive value is CR.
- `balance`: The balance of the account after the transaction happened, however, the field might be empty for some accounts, such as credit card account.
- `trancode`: It's a category code for the transaction, such as ATM, EFTPOS, cash out might be different code.
- `receiptnumber`: The receipt number for the transaction. However, I cannot found it on my real paper receipt, and the field might be missing for some accounts, such as credit card account.
- `link`: Transactions using the new payments platform will have a link for retrieving extended information on the transaction.
